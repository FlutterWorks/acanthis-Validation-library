# Acanthis

Acanthis is a simple and easy to use validation library for Dart. It is inspired by [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) although it is not a port of it. Acanthis is tailored to the Dart language and its features and is type-safe and composable.

## Why Acanthis?

Acanthis provides validation for most of the Dart built-in types and allows you to create custom validators.

But that's not all! Acanthis is designed to be composable, so you can create complex validators by combining simpler ones.
